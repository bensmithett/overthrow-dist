overthrow-dist
==============

[Overthrow](https://github.com/filamentgroup/overthrow) <del>doesn't include a built version of the library. This is a bower component with the latest built version.</del>

**Overthrow's repo contains [built versions](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Overthrow/tree/master/dist) now!** You don't need this component any more. Don't use it.

I'm leaving this repo here for the foreseeable future for anyone already using it with Bower, but no plans to update beyond Overthrow v0.5.0.
